        <p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong><br>
            Nithish Kumar B<br>
            Final Year Student, Department of AI & ML<br>

        <p><strong>Purpose of the Study:</strong><br>
            This study aims to analyze brainwave signals using the NeuroSky MindLink Mobile 2 to develop an adaptive learning model that can improve student focus and performance. The signals will be processed using STFT and Kalman filters to classify different cognitive states.</p>

        <p><strong>Procedures:</strong><br>
            As a participant, you will be asked to:
            <ul>
                <li>Wear the NeuroSky headset during study sessions (05-10 minutes).</li>
                <li>Participate in basic learning/focus activities.</li>
                <li>Allow EEG data collection for research use.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Voluntary Participation:</strong><br>
            Participation is voluntary. You may withdraw at any time without penalty.</p>

        <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong><br>
            Your data will be anonymized and stored securely. No identifying info will be included in publications.</p>

        <p><strong>Risks and Discomforts:</strong><br>
            There are no known risks. You may feel minor discomfort wearing the headset for longer time(1-2hrs) but we are used to do this(it is maximum of 15mins).</p>

        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong><br>
            While no direct benefit is guaranteed, your contribution supports research in adaptive learning systems.</p>
